# Problem 1

``` r
wapo_csv_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicides <- read_csv(wapo_csv_url)
```

The raw data from The Washington Post contains 52179 observations and 12
columns where each observation represents a homicide from the last
decade in the 50 largest American cities. Each observation includes
demographic information pertaining to the victim (name \[`victim_last`,
`victim_first`\], race \[`victim_race`\], age at time of death
\[`victim_age`\], and sex \[`victim sex`\]) along with the coordinates
of the murder (`lat`, `lon`) and whether an arrest was made
(`disposition`).

###### Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homicides <-
  homicides %>% 
    mutate(
      city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state), 
      reported_date = as.character(reported_date) %>% 
        as_date(format = "%Y%m%d")
    ) %>% 
    relocate(
      city_state, .after = state
    )

homicides_per_city <-
  homicides %>% 
    mutate(
      case = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), "unsolved", "solved")
    ) %>% 
    group_by(city_state, case) %>% 
    summarize(
      homicide_count = n()
    )

homicides_per_city_total <- 
    homicides_per_city %>% 
    group_by(city_state) %>% 
    summarize(
      homicide_count = sum(homicide_count)
    ) %>% 
    mutate(
      case = "total"
    ) %>% 
    relocate(case, .after = city_state)

homicides_per_city <-
  bind_rows(homicides_per_city, homicides_per_city_total) %>% 
  mutate(
    case = factor(case, levels = c("solved", "unsolved", "total"))
  ) %>% 
  arrange(city_state, case) %>% 
  filter(case != "solved") %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "case", 
    values_from = "homicide_count"
  ) 
```

###### For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

``` r
baltimore_prop_tbl <-
  homicides_per_city %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_prop <-
  prop.test(pull(baltimore_prop_tbl, unsolved), pull(baltimore_prop_tbl, total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

The estimated proportion of unsolved homicides in the last decade from
Baltimore, MD is 0.6455607 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.6275625,
0.6631599).
