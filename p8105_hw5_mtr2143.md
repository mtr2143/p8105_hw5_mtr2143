# Problem 1

``` r
wapo_csv_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicides <- read_csv(wapo_csv_url)
```

The raw data from The Washington Post contains 52179 observations and 12
columns where each observation represents a homicide from the last
decade in the 50 largest American cities. Each observation includes
demographic information pertaining to the victim (name \[`victim_last`,
`victim_first`\], race \[`victim_race`\], age at time of death
\[`victim_age`\], and sex \[`victim sex`\]) along with the coordinates
of the murder (`lat`, `lon`) and whether an arrest was made
(`disposition`).
