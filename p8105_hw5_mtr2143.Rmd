# Problem 1

```{r, load wapo data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

wapo_csv_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicides <- read_csv(wapo_csv_url)
```

The raw data from The Washington Post contains `r nrow(homicides)` observations and `r ncol(homicides)` columns where each observation represents a homicide from the last decade in the 50 largest American cities. Each observation includes demographic information pertaining to the victim (name [`victim_last`, `victim_first`], race [`victim_race`], age at time of death [`victim_age`], and sex [`victim sex`]) along with the coordinates of the murder (`lat`, `lon`) and whether an arrest was made (`disposition`).
